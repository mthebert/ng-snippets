# NG-Snippets

This project is full of sample code snippets that I think would be useful to have on hand for [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) my web app development.

Examples are using Angular 1.2.7

I have added Bootstrap to make them look a little better

The source of some of the snippets are sometimes modified examples or snippets turned into working angular from Ari Lerner's ng-book.  A great cookbook of angular concepts.
